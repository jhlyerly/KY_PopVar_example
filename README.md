# KY_PopVar_example
Example for running PopVar to predict crosses with a set of parents.

This project was initially created for Dave VanSanford at the University of KY as an example for students to run PopVar as part of a course. It has been generalized for anyone with some example data and output files.

Data includes a phenotype file, and genotype file, a map, and a list of parents. We will use the PopVar package in R to predict crosses for several traits.

Some visualizations for traits of interest are included, as well as examples for creating tables of how many times a parent is selected in the "best" crosses.
